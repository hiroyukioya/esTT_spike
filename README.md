# ESTT Project: Electrical Stimulation Recording of Human Brain and Single-Unit Analysis of Spike Activity

## Overview

The **ESTT Project** focuses on the electrical stimulation and recording of brain activity, particularly targeting the neural responses and spike activity in the human brain. It involves the collection of electrophysiological data through brain stimulation techniques, followed by the analysis of single-unit neural spikes. This project aims to further our understanding of neural encoding, brain stimulation therapies, and the interactions between brain circuits in response to electrical stimuli.

## Objectives

- **Electrical Stimulation**: Deliver controlled electrical stimulation to targeted areas of the brain to evoke neural responses and map brain activity.
- **Spike Activity Recording**: Record single-unit activity from individual neurons to study their firing patterns and the dynamics of neural populations.
- **Neural Data Analysis**: Analyze recorded data to identify neural signatures, classify spike events, and understand the relationship between brain regions, stimuli, and cognitive functions.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Brain Recording**: Continuous monitoring of neural activity in response to electrical stimulation.
- **Single-Unit Spike Sorting**: Detect and classify individual neural spikes to investigate the behavior of single neurons.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualization tools to observe neural firing patterns, brain network activity, and responses to stimulation.
- **Neurostimulation Protocols**: Implementation of different electrical stimulation protocols to evaluate responses in various conditions.

## Components

- **Electrical Stimulation Hardware**: Equipment for safely delivering electrical pulses to specific brain regions.
- **Neural Recording Devices**: Multi-channel electrophysiological recording systems to capture spike activity from the brain.
- **Data Acquisition and Processing Software**: Tools for collecting, processing, and analyzing neural data in real-time.
- **Analysis Pipeline**: Software for spike detection, sorting, and statistical analysis of neural firing patterns.
